### FTS-TASK11 - facilitating CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Node.js and ReactJS

### :stars: Overview
This repository creates a TODO List web application with various features to manage tasks efficiently. It implements a user-friendly interface that allows users to add, update, and remove TODO items. 
The web app performs CRUD operations on todos' list. It consists of a frontend (FE) component that complements the backend (BE) part of the website.

- Search for Tasks.
- Count the number of TODOs in the footer.
- Asynchronous JavaScript methods: are used for API interactions (e.g., Fetch API, async/await).
